# 'a beginners guide to creative computing'
<h4>This is a log of my first week exploring and reflecting on creative computing and the community it fosters</h4>
<p>[it's also a documentation of how intimidating it can be so that you don't feel like a fool!]</p>
<p>........</p>
<p><h4>Definitions</h4></p>
<p>First off, lets clear up the jargon used in creative computing to make the space a bit more accessible and understandable.</p>
<em>Creative computing:</em> The cross section between the creative arts and computing, as well as the community surrounding it.</p>
<p><em>Physical computing:</em> interacting with real objects by programming them from a computer, e.g. Arduino, which is an easy to use electronics platform.
<p><em>Open source:</em> computer software that is released for use by anyone, for any purpose.
<p><em>README file:</em> The first file that users read when opening a new software for the first time. It tends to include crucial instructions or details. This is a README file, one that you read before you start creative computing. 
<p><em>Computer programming:</em> designing and building computer softwares.
<p><em>STEAM:</em> stands for science, technology, engineering, arts and maths - acknowledging that the arts are a huge part of the scientific industry. 
<p>........</p>
<p><h4>Research and References</h4></p> 
<p>Some useful research and reference points to get yourself familiar with the type of projects that can come about thanks to creative computing</p>
<p><em>Stack Overflow:</em> A question and answer platform for everything computing. An ideal place to search for answers among beginners and experts (https://stackoverflow.com/)
<p><em>Digi-gxl</em> a platform that champions womxn, trans people, intersex, non binary and essentially anyone that isnâ€™t a cis white male in the industry. The platform functions as an agency and support network, allowing more of the under represented to be seen (https://www.instagram.com/digi.gxl/?hl=en)
