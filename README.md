# 'a beginners guide to creative computing'
<h4>This is a log of my first week exploring and reflecting on creative computing and the community it fosters</h4>
<p>[it's also a documentation of how intimidating it can be so that you don't feel like a fool!]</p>
<p>........</p>
<p><h4>Definitions</h4></p>
<p>First off, lets clear up the jargon used in creative computing to make the space a bit more accessible and understandable.</p>
<em>Creative computing:</em> The cross section between the creative arts and computing, as well as the community surrounding it.</p>
<p><em>Physical computing:</em> interacting with real objects by programming them from a computer, e.g. Arduino, which is an easy-to-use electronics platform.
<p><em>Open source:</em> computer software that is released for use by anyone, for any purpose.
<p><em>README file:</em> The first file that users read when opening a new software for the first time. It tends to include crucial instructions or details. This is a README file, one that you can read before you start creative computing. 
<p><em>Computer programming:</em> designing and building computer softwares through coding.
<p><em>STEAM:</em> stands for science, technology, engineering, arts and maths - acknowledging that the arts are a huge part of the scientific industry. 
<p>........</p>
<p><h4>Research and References</h4></p> 
<p>Some useful research and reference points to get yourself familiar with the type of projects that can come about thanks to creative computing.</p>
<p><em>Stack Overflow:</em> A question and answer platform for everything computing. An ideal place to search for answers among beginners and experts (https://stackoverflow.com/)</p>
<p><em>Digi-gxl:</em> a platform that champions womxn, trans people, intersex, non binary and essentially anyone that isnâ€™t a cis white male in the industry. The platform functions as an agency and support network, allowing more of the under represented to be seen (https://www.instagram.com/digi.gxl/?hl=en)</p>

<p><em>Society Centred Design:</em> a manifesto that suggests how we need to move from user centred design to community centred design, thinking of design benefits on a larger scale (https://societycentered.design/)</p>
<p><em>Experiments with Google:</em> a really cool platform with many open source experiments that can be accessed by anyone. A great example of open source resources (https://experiments.withgoogle.com/collection/digitalwellbeing)</p>

<p><h4>My experience learning creative computing</h4></p>
<p>The first task set on Monday to create a circuit that lit up an LED gave me a good basic understanding of how the Arduino hardware worked. By completing this first circuit as a group, we were able to help each other out and foster a small sense of community as many of us were beginners at this point.</p>

<p>I decided to strengthen my experience with the Arduino board and set up a "love-o-meter" that measures temperature, progressively lighting up LED's. I completed this alongside a peer, allowing me to confide in them when help was needed.</p>

<p>Creating this README file has also been a huge learning point, especially as i spent the majority of the week trying to figure out how to create one. I have used HTML to programme this file as seen below and had to learn the basics very very quickly.</p>

<p><h4>Reflecting on my learning</h4></p> 
<p>For being a complete beginner with creative computing, i think i did an okay job of taking information in and exploring the subject. I much prefered working with the physical Arduino board compared to the online simulation, as being tactile with it taught me a lot more. As a graphics student I also love how visual the physical version was. Looking back, i do think that a more in-depth Monday session would have benefitted my learning more, as i spent half of the week slightly confused trying to figure out what i was meant to be creating.</p> 
<p>.......</p>
<p><h4>How can a community can be developed around creative computing?</h4></p> 
<p>Speaking from experience, creative computing is a very intimidating field for a beginner. By generating open source resources and a welcoming space, i do think that a really positive community can develop as proven by groups such as 'digi-gxl' who champion the minorities within the industry. Removing all gatekeeping from computing and making it as accessible as possible to everyone is the direction the field must go in order to foster a sense of community. Making sure that people can make mistakes and ask for help is also crucial, keeping the flow of information open.</p>
<p>.......</p>
<p><h4>A final message to new learners</h4></p>
<p>Don't give up! Although very intimidating and confusing, persevere. Make sure to cover the basics and have a solid understanding of the fundamentals of the subject, as i am still doing. We are all beginners at some point!</p>
